# 🌐 Project Nexus: The Global Student Resilience Hub

## 🚀 Project Overview (TAM Perspective)

This repository documents the development of the "Global Student Resilience Hub"—a web application built to address stress and disconnection among online students.

**My Role:** **Project Lead (Miss Pixel) & Technical Account Manager (TAM) Trainee.**

As the Project Lead, my primary focus was not coding, but bridging the gap between our **Business, Health, and Engineering Units** to ensure successful delivery.

### Key Management & Coordination Responsibilities:

* **Stakeholder Management:** Orchestrating a team of 15 members across 3 continents and multiple time zones.
* **Requirements Definition:** Creating and maintaining the **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** to ensure alignment between the vision and the technical implementation (MVP).
* **Documentation & Organization:** Establishing clear communication channels (WhatsApp Community) and organizing the repository structure (see project files).
* **Feature Integration:** Overseeing the successful integration of our unique **"Nexus Soundscapes" (Focus Zone)** into the product architecture.
* **Timeline Adherence:** Managing the 6-week MVP timeline to ensure the team meets critical deadlines.
